Established in October 2020, Sunkwa ("cry for life") Music & Dance Academy is a non-profit art organization that works with vulnerable and less-privileged children in Adenta, a suburb of Accra, Ghana.

Dedicated to helping children to reach their potential, the group improves the lives of young local students in numerous ways by teaching them about their rich heritage. With a focus on [Indigenous cultural drumming and dancing](./drumming), the Academy also offers children instruction in basic education, ICT training, education on important public issues, and humanitarian activities. Sunkwa aims to holistically address issues affecting childrens' livelihoods, to advance their education, and to develop their abilities to enable them participate fully in society. 

The troupe is led by nationally renowned Ghanaian professional drummers and dancers. The children hope to perform their traditions for local and international audiences.
